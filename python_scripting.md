# Scripting 

### What is scripting?

Tackling a specific task and looking to automate it via a piece of code. 
This is different to programming which looks to solve more complex cases. 

The key difference between scripting and programming is the scope of what they try to achieve.

### Why Python for scripting? 

- Easy to understand
- Language interoperability (python is very capable of talking to other systems)
- Many libraries!
- Massive community (Documentation, Discussion)
